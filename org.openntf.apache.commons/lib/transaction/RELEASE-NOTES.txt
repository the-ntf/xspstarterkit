- Added functions to FileResourceManager for copying and moving resources.
- Added possibility to append to (instead of overwriting) an existing resource with writeResource in FileResourceManager.
- Added LoggerFacade implementation for Jakarta Commons Logging

BUGFIXES FROM 1.1
-----------------
- Fixed bugzilla issue 35201. Maps in AbstractXAResource now are synchronized to avoid problems in multi threaded scenarios.
- Fixed bug reported by Niklas Gustavsson on http://www.mail-archive.com/commons-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg69441.html.
  Failed deletion of a file now throws an exception and enters an error state upon commit.
- Reduced likelyhood of clash between internally generated and external tx id in generatedUniqueTxId
- Fixed bugzilla issue 35377. Synchronizing on Set activeTransactions while iterating over its items in
  OptimisticMapWrapper.copyChangesToConcurrentTransactions() for preventing ConcurrentModificationException.
- Fixed bugzilla issue 37379. The construction of the transaction specific path is now done via a TransactionIdToPathMapper.
- Fixed issue with deleteResource(..) and createResource(..) of FileResourceManager seen as read-only operations.
- Fixed issue with AbstractXAResource. Resources did not get released when prepare(..) returns XA_RDONLY as no
  commit(..) is triggered by the TransactionManager explicitely.
- TransactionalMapWrapper now properly supports null values. Bug report and fix supplied by Greg Steckman at http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38545
